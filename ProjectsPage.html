                <!-- First Project -->
                <div class="project-item">
                    <h3>Project Title 1: Computer Architecture - MIPS Project </h3>
                    <p>This project was all about practicing and understanding the different computer architectures and comparing how they work. Through this project we wrote and tested MIPS, ARMv7, and RISC-V. For ARMv7, we built a simple arithmetic calculator that could take input and handle basic operations. In RISC-V, the focus was on creating a Fibonacci sequence program, using both recursive and iterative approaches. The project then compared and analyzed the two architectures, looking at both the instruction sets, performance and the design principles.</p>
                </div>
    
                <!-- Second Project -->
                <div class="project-item">
                    <h3>Project Title 2: Writing and Critical Thinking - Toronto Homeownership</h3>
                    <p>This project included an essay that analyzed a video which discussed the current challenge of homeownership in Canada, particularly Toronto. In this analysis it covered the intended audience, the tone, and the language of the video, as well as the effectiveness of the argument. This essay took a close look at affordability, comparing todayâ€™s housing costs to those of the 1990s and evaluated the impact of population growth and wage stagnation on the housing market. </p>
                </div>
    
                <!-- Third Project -->
                <div class="project-item">
                    <h3>Project Title 3: Obj Oriented Programming IT - Simple Banking System</h3>
                    <p>This project was about building a simple banking system using Python using object-oriented programing concepts. It started with an abstract base class to represent deposits, withdrawals, and balances. With that we created two accounts, A Saving account and a Checking account with overdraft protection. This project was a good way of practice and deepening our knowledge in abstraction, inheritance, and exception handling in Python.</p>
                </div>

                <!-- Fourth Project -->
                <div class="project-item">
                    <h3>Project Title 4: Computer Architecture - Computer Storage</h3>
                    <p>This project was about exploring the different types of computer memory and how they work and the purpose in a system. This project was focused on RAM, ROM, and Cache, of which we explained their roles, speed, and capacity. The project also compared each of their speeds and sizes, and explained how all three work together in order to complete tasks like booting up, running applications, and speeding up CPU operations.</p>
                </div>
    
                <!-- Fifth Project -->
                <div class="project-item">
                    <h3>Project Title 5: Management of Enterprise - Sustainable Development Goals</h3>
                    <p>This project was a group presentation where we had to connect Sustainable Development Goals with a course topic and real company. This assignment looked at how a company applies sustainable practices to its supply chain, sourcing, and production methods. We explained how the operations of our company supported SDGs by reducing waste, lowering emissions, and empowering Indigenous communities.</p>
