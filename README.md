## Viewports
Instead of keeping all breakpoints in one responsive.css, we’ll create three separate files:
mobile.css - for phones (≤ 600px)
tablet.css - for tablets (601px – 1024px)
desktop.css - for desktops/laptops (≥ 1025px)

## Color Scheme
Created using [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create).  
My chosen scheme uses shades of purple, gray, and dark blue to create a modern and professional aesthetic:

- Primary Purple: #6C67F0
- Medium Purple: #7876C4
- Dark Gray: #22213D
- Accent Dark Blue: #2F2E42
- Secondary Gray: #77769C
- Highlight Neutral: #626270

This combination provides contrast, readability, and visual estatic website across different devices.
